The IETF LLC is committed to resolving security vulnerabilities quickly and carefully. If you believe you have discovered a security related issue within our online systems, then please help us by disclosing the issue to us by following the process below.

## Process

Contact us via email (EMAIL) with a detailed report of the potential vulnerability.  If you believe the vulnerability is serious or there is a chance that email is insecure, then please encrypt the message with PGP using this PGP Key (LINK).  

Your email should include as much of the following as possible:
* Type of vulnerability.
* Whether the information has been published or shared with others.
* Step-by-step instructions/proof-of-concept codes to replicate the issue.

You will receive a reply to acknowledge that we have received your report.  We will then review the information and work to validate the reported vulnerability.  If the  vulnerability is validated we will complete the investigation and notify you. Where appropriate you will receive results of the vulnerability findings, a plan for resolution and plans for public disclosure.

## Limitations

* Causing, or attempting to cause, a Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

## User Security

So that we may protect the security of our users we request that any potential vulnerability that you believe you have discovered is not shared outside of trusted circles, until we have had the opportunity to research, respond and address the reported vulnerability and inform users if needed. We also ask that you do not share or post any information on our users that you are not authorised to access, in any environment. We aim to address all validated vulnerabilities that are brought to our attention as quickly as possible.

## Our Commitment

If you act in good faith and follow this process then we make the following commitments to you:
* The information that you share with us as part of this process will be kept confidential within the IETF LLC, our directly contracted vendors and a small team of volunteers.  It will not be shared with other third-parties without your permission.
* We will not initiate legal action against security researchers attempting to find vulnerabilities within our systems who adhere to this policy.
* If you report a vulnerability that materially affects our services or infrastructure then with your consent we will give you thanks with public acknowledgement.
